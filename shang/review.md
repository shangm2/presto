## Project Impact

### Event Loop Migration Project

**Context/Background:**

- Presto coordinator task handling initially used a thread pool model that suffered from high CPU overhead
- Synchronization costs dramatically increased with query volume, creating bottlenecks
- Resource management and queuing time were significant pain points for users

**My Role:**

- Led complete redesign of Presto's task handling architecture from thread pool to event loop model
- Implemented complex architectural changes while maintaining backward compatibility
- Drove project from conception through implementation and production deployment

**Outcomes:**

- Achieved 90% reduction in CPU time usage on the Presto task scheduler
- Enabled higher cluster utilization and increased query throughput without additional hardware
- Significantly reduced high-percentile query latencies during periods of high cluster activity
- Facilitated single-coordinator architecture which improved cache hit rates compared to multi-coordinator setups

### JSON to Thrift Migration Project

**Context/Background:**

- Coordinator-worker communication relied on inefficient JSON serialization
- Serialization overhead limited coordinator's ability to handle concurrent queries
- Complex interconnected data structures made migration challenging

**My Role:**

- Designed and implemented phased migration strategy for transitioning from JSON to Thrift
- Modified open-source Drift library to support Presto's specific serialization needs
- Authored RFC and presented to Presto open-source community
- Mentored team members working on related components

**Outcomes:**

- Significantly reduced CPU usage for split serialization on coordinator nodes
- Improved coordinator efficiency, enabling it to handle more concurrent queries
- Created measurable performance improvements through dashboard monitoring
- Established framework for continued serialization optimization of complex data structures

## Engineering Excellence

- Implemented complex concurrency model change by eliminating synchronization overhead through serialized operations
  with event loops
- Designed a sophisticated multi-phase migration strategy for transitioning complex data structures to Thrift
- Quickly identified and mitigated a production issue caused by Tetris table movement, coordinating cross-team response
  to reduce impact
- Built comprehensive dashboards to track and visualize performance improvements from both projects in production
- Demonstrated exceptional troubleshooting skills by resolving critical end-to-end test failures for Presto native
  worker, unblocking important releases

## Direction

- Identified architectural limitations rather than pursuing incremental optimizations
- Authored and presented detailed RFC to the Presto open-source community through the TSC meeting
- Developed comprehensive implementation plans while coordinating with stakeholders
- Successfully managed transitions and production enablement across clusters
- Established measurable performance benchmarks to validate improvements at each phase

## People

- Mentored Henry during his onboarding, providing in-depth discussions on Presto architecture and selecting appropriate
  hands-on tasks
- Provided weekend support to debug and fix critical end-to-end test failures, earning recognition from team members
- Served as a go-to resource for Presto architecture and implementation details, helping numerous colleagues with
  production issues and code questions
- Guided team member Vivian on the C++ worker implementation for the Thrift migration
- Built strong cross-team relationships through responsive troubleshooting assistance, documented by appreciation emails
