# Peer Feedback for Rohit

Rohit has been consistently helpful as a manager throughout my projects. His support goes beyond just checking in - he
actively connects me with the right people and resources when I need them. This practical approach has removed obstacles
and kept my work moving forward.

What stands out is how Rohit encourages me to share my work with broader audiences. This has improved both the
visibility of my contributions and helped me develop professionally by getting diverse feedback.

I particularly value his guidance on complex projects. Rohit provides clear advice on navigating stakeholder
relationships and securing buy-in from different teams. His suggestions about who to involve and when have prevented
potential roadblocks that would have delayed progress.

Rohit's management style balances giving me enough independence while still providing direction when needed. This
approach has helped me grow more confident in my decision-making while still having the support I need when facing
challenges.
