# Peer Feedback for Vivian

Working with Vivian on the thrift migration project has been a productive partnership. Her quick mastery of C++ and our
codebase shows her strong learning ability and dedication. I recognize that this likely required significant personal
time investment, which has directly contributed to our project success.

Vivian's technical contributions stand out in how she actively participates in discussions and effectively collaborates
with the Pressisimo team to ensure timely code merges. Her clear explanations about protocol impacts between coordinator
and native worker have been valuable for all stakeholders.

Her willingness to join me in presenting our RFC to the open source community demonstrates her commitment to gathering
diverse perspectives and representing our work well.

For continued growth, I've noticed Vivian sometimes spends extra time perfecting non-critical areas that could be
addressed later. While her attention to detail is valuable, balancing this perfectionism with project deadlines would
help us maintain focus on priority deliverables.

Overall, Vivian's technical skills and collaborative approach have been key to completing phase 1 and bringing phase 2
close to completion.

# Revised Peer Feedback for Henry

Henry has shown good initiative during his onboarding period. By talking directly with stakeholders to understand his
tasks, he quickly became self-sufficient. His ability to work through requirements and deliver production code shows
solid technical skills.

I value Henry's questions about our company, team, and projects, which shows his interest in understanding our
organization. His direct communication helps him connect with team members while getting the information he needs.

Areas for growth:

1. Sharing regular updates in our team channel would help others see what he's working on and offer help when needed.

2. Joining more oncall debugging sessions would speed up his learning about how Presto works in production and expose
   him to useful troubleshooting situations.

Overall, Henry's approach to learning and his focus on quality work have made supporting him as his onboarding buddy
straightforward and rewarding.
